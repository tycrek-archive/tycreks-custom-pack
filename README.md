# tycreks-custom-pack

My personal Minecraft resource pack that I use on 2b2t.org.

## Features

- **Soft textures** (makes highway flying on 2b2t much easier)
  - Obsidian
  - Netherrack
  - Bedrock
- **Steve Totem** (The classic Steve skin adapted to the Totem texture)
- **MEG Pickaxe** (Motorway Extension Guru's custom diamond pickaxe)
- **2b2t Panorama** (huge thanks to [u/ytombot](https://old.reddit.com/user/ytombot) for their [panorama](https://old.reddit.com/r/2b2t/comments/hy9e0o/i_made_a_2b2t_ui/))
- **Smooth font** (A slightly smoother font)

## Usage

1. Download the pack from [Releases](https://github.com/tycrek/tycreks-custom-pack/releases)
2. Place the `.zip` in `./minecraft/resourcepacks/` (do **not** extract it)
3. Place at the top of your resource pack list in-game
4. Enjoy!

## F.A.Q

- **Q**: Is this a virus? **A**: Lol.
- **Q**: Does it work with other packs? **A**: Yes. Just place this one at the top of the list to override the other packs.
- **Q**: Can you add x texture? **A**: No. I don't do requests.
- **Q**: Steve totem is ugly, fix him! **A**: No. He's my child.
- **Q**: I don't like MEG pickaxe. Can I remove it? **A**: Yes. Unzip the pack, navigate to the folder containing the file diamond_pickaxe.png and just delete that file. Then zip the pack again and put it back into the resource packs folder.
- **Q**: How did you make the pack? **A**: I used RPW and GIMP.
